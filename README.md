# The Singleton Pattern: You're Doing It Wrong

## Overview

This repo contains all source code from my GDEX 2021 presentation _The Singleton Pattern: You're Doing It Wrong_. Watch the [recording]() of the talk for background.

There are three subfolders, each containing the Unity 2021.1 project for a simple _Flappy Bird_ clone.

1. `FlappyClone_Spaghetti`: an implementation of the game using basic spaghetti code, with no high-level architecture in place to manage dependencies
2. `FlappyClone_StaticSingletons`: an implementation of the game using the static singletons anti-pattern
3. `FlappyClone_DependencyInjection`: an implementation of the game using dependency injection
